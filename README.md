# casbot
A dumb Twitchbot. It is worse than all the rest, but it is mine. 🦆

Learning project for node, modularization, es6+ (probably es8+ because async/await), promises and JS unit testing mainly. Do not expect this to be good code! 🤷‍♂️

## Maybe... 
- Define core functionality
- Design for plugins (addons)
- This is core, plugins are separate projects, actual bot is project using all projects
- Unit testing + linting 💆

## Possibly use in future...
- Mocha (unit tests)
- Hyped UI library of the season (if I ever come round to actually using this thing)
